TypeScript (TS) is a programming language built by Microsoft.
It’s a superset of JavaScript (JS), meaning everything in JavaScript also works in TypeScript, plus some extra powerful features.

In short:
TypeScript = JavaScript + Type Safety + Better Tools

You write code in .ts files → TypeScript then compiles it into normal JavaScript (.js) so browsers can run it.
