Enum (short for “enumeration”) is a feature in TypeScript that allows you to define a set of named constants,
a group of related values that make your code more readable and maintainable.

Types of enums:
1.Numeric Enums (Default)
If you don’t assign values, TypeScript automatically starts numbering from 0.
